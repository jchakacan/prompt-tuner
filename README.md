# prompt-tuner
This is a simple, prompt tuner coded in Python and packaged with PyInstaller to be self-contained. Suggestions for improvement welcome!

Please, be gentle as I'm very new to programming and github in general.

Here are instructions for the apps use:

To use the Art Prompt Generator, simply click on the category buttons to reveal the available prompts. Click on a prompt to select it, and it will be added to the "Prompt" field at the top of the GUI.

If you would like to add negative prompts to your generated prompt, click on one of the negative prompt buttons and select the negative prompts that you want to include. They will be added to the "Negative Prompt" field below the "Prompt" field.

Once you have selected a prompt and any desired negative prompts, you can copy the text in the "Prompt" and "Negative Prompt" fields to use in your art project.

When you are finished using the Art Prompt Generator, simply close the GUI window.
